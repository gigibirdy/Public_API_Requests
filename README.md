# Public_API_Requests

This project utilized Fetch API to retrieve 12 employees records from randomuserAPI endpoint and append to a webpage. 
By clicking one of employee cards, a modal window will pop up to show additional information about this employee. Each modal 
window contains a close button to exit the modal model, a copy button which allows user easily copy content of current modal
window, a previous and next button to review previous and next employee information without existing the modal model. 
Search bar provides instant search result while user is entering search input. 

List of additional features and style changes:
1. add a loading overlay to improve user experience. If there is a network error, an error message will be printed to 
the overlay.
2. add a copy button for every modal window, so user can easily copy employees' information by clicking the button.
3. add box shadow for each card.
4. add background image for main content.
